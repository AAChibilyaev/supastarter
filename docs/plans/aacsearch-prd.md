# AACsearch — Status PRD

> **Read this first** for orientation. Full vision and execution plan: [`docs/plans/aacsearch/`](./aacsearch/index.md).

## What it is

AACsearch is a hosted **search-as-a-service** for e-commerce and CRM catalogs. Self-hostable on this supastarter monorepo; ships with a managed cloud option.

Merchants install a CMS module (PrestaShop, Bitrix), connect their AACsearch project, and get a fast typo-tolerant search endpoint plus a hosted widget — without running Typesense ops themselves.

## Hard project constraint right now

**DB is frozen** — no Prisma migrations / schema deltas without explicit approval. Any feature that requires new persistence (`Project`, `Connector`, `SyncJob`, `WidgetConfig`, `AnalyticsEvent`, `UsageCounter` rollups, …) must call out the DB change up front and wait. Until then, build on the 25 existing models.

## Where we are vs. where we're going

## Half-orphaned — keep, don't extend

`@repo/billing-wallet`, `@repo/ai-core`, kopecks ledger, Tochka top-up driver, oRPC `billing-wallet` module, settings UI. Code is intact but **not** wired to search-units billing yet (that's v0.6). Do not extend without an explicit task.

## Removed in last commit (`84481e3`) — do NOT recreate

- `apps/saas/app/api/cron/sync-subscriptions/route.ts`
- `packages/api/lib/wallet-sync.ts`

## Out of repo (parked, do not influence)

- `archive/cursor-rules/dslmrank.mdc` — legacy rules from a different project (DSLMRank).
- `docs/plans/archive/dslmrank-build-plan-v2.md` — same.

These are kept for reference only and **must not** influence current work.

## Pricing posture (draft, not committed)

- **Free** — 10K units/month, 1 index, community support, `aacsearch.com` subdomain only.
- **Pro** ($29/mo) — 1M units/month, 10 indexes, custom origin allow-list, email support.
- **Enterprise** (custom) — unmetered, dedicated cluster, SSO, SLA 99.95%, audit log.

(One **search-unit** = 1 search request OR 1 document indexed.)

## Roadmap signal (loose)

- v0.x (now) — Single-doc upsert ✅, multi-search ✅, browser SDK ✅, scoped tokens ✅, rate-limit ✅, quota ✅, reindex ✅
- v0.5 — Public marketing site ⬅ **current focus**
- v0.6 — Stripe billing wired to search-units
- v0.7 — Public docs site (`apps/docs`)
- v1.0 — Self-host quickstart + Helm chart
- v1.x — CMS connectors (PrestaShop, Bitrix), hosted widget, full vision per `docs/plans/aacsearch/`
